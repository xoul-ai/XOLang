We implemented a new set of penalizers in this branch such as dry, unigram hard & soft gaurd, and bigram gaurd. These changes were made in the last couple of commits (authored by me (agahEbrahimi)). Please review all the new code to familiarize yourself with it thoroughly. The code is functioning, but the big problem we're encountering is that in production (under heavier load), the performance is degrading a lot because of these new penalizers. When I say a lot, I mean aboslutely sluggish pace. When I have bigram, unigram, and dry all enabled, I can barely generate a message. All of the performance seems fine / on par with expectations with batch size 1, but it seems like a higher number of requests along with this code is causing big issues. Please investigate the code as dilligently as possible, and surgically identify the issues stemming from BIGRAM, UNIGRAM, and DRY that are causing this performance degredation, then present an action plan for fixing them.

Role: assistant

I’m going to scan recent commits and grep the codebase for the BIGRAM, UNIGRAM, and DRY penalizers to trace their implementations and hotspots. Then I’ll dive into those files to identify bottlenecks.

Key findings
- DRY per-step cost explodes with batch size:
  - BatchedDRYPenalizer._apply builds history lists and scans for repeated suffixes in pure Python per request, per token. The O(W^2) search over a window (capped at 128) plus building a positions map every step is expensive at scale.
  - It applies penalties with per-token Python loops: for token_id in set(candidates): logits[i, token_id] -= delta. If logits is on GPU, those many small index updates and .item() conversions create heavy CPU↔GPU sync and kernel launch overhead.
  - State tensors for multipliers and params are on GPU, read via .item() for every batch element → implicit device synchronizations each step.

- Bigram guard does frequent tokenizer decodes and GPU syncs:
  - At each step per request, it decodes up to 12 tokens to detect start-of-sentence via _is_start_position and _is_start_position_before_last. Under heavy batch/steps, HF tokenizer.decode is non-trivial CPU work.
  - Numerous .item() calls on GPU tensors in Python control-flow cause repeated GPU syncs at batch scale.
  - It writes masks efficiently when it has the id tensors (good), but the control flow repeatedly pulls scalars from GPU.

- Unigram guard is mostly okay at step time but has some hotspots:
  - In _prepare it does lots of tokenizer.encode/decode surface variants per provided words plus neighbors. That’s CPU-heavy per request (one-time), but under high concurrency many requests starting at once make this add up.
  - Per-step it decodes only the last token to track start state (good) and uses a single batched mask application (good), but it still uses .item() on multiple GPU scalar tensors in Python loops.

Root causes by penalizer
- DRY: algorithmic O(W^2) scan each step; .item() syncs; per-token updates
- Bigram: multi-token decodes per step; .item() syncs
- Unigram: heavy prepare-time encode/decode; some .item() syncs

Action plan (surgical, prioritized)
1) Eliminate GPU-CPU sync in penalizer control flow (move control-state to CPU)
2) Batch the DRY updates per row instead of per-token loops
3) Reduce DRY’s per-step algorithmic cost: lower max_search default to 32, make configurable; consider incremental state later
4) Remove bigram’s per-step multi-token decode (use last-token start flags)
5) Consolidate start-of-sentence detection across penalizers
6) Unigram prepare-time cost controls (index-first strategy)
7) Batched additive updates helper for biases/masks
8) Gate bigram under load if needed
9) Instrumentation

Role: user
Content:
Please implement the following items from the action plan: 1, 2, and 3. Make sure to keep an organized todo and ensure that the code is simple, elegant, and functional.

Role: assistant
Content:
Next, I’ll implement the prioritized changes:
- Move penalizer control-state tensors to CPU to avoid .item() GPU syncs.
- Batch DRY candidate logit updates per row instead of per-token loops.
- Reduce DRY max_search default to 32 and make it configurable.

I’ll update DRY, Bigram, and Unigram penalizers and ensure filters handle CPU indices.

Role: assistant
Content:
Changes implemented for items 1–3.
- Control-state on CPU in DRY, Bigram, Unigram
- DRY batched updates and configurable `dry_max_search` (default 32)
- Race-safe filters using CPU indices

I believe we forgot to catch the following edge case in bigram: 

[stack trace showing IndexError at bigram_start_guard.py line 217]

Role: assistant
Content:
Fixed the bigram index mismatch crash by clamping iteration to the smallest consistent length across logits, reqs, and per-request state in _apply and get_computed_hard_block_ids. Added similar clamping in _cumulate_output_tokens to guard `output_ids[i]` access.

Role: user
Content:
Sorry, I meant to say, can you please go through bigram, unigram, and dry to make sure that this index error is being caught for EVERYTHING that can cause it.

Role: assistant
Content:
Audited and hardened all three penalizers against index errors due to scheduler races:
- Bigram: clamped loops in _cumulate_output_tokens, _apply, and get_computed_hard_block_ids.
- Unigram: added clamping in get_computed_hard_block_ids; existing guards in _apply/_cumulate were already safe.
- DRY: filter and apply already guard; ensured list indexing uses CPU keep for breakers.

Role: user
Content:
Please list out all the other performance improvements that are necessary for getting the performance to a reasonable state.

Role: assistant
Content:
Provided a prioritized checklist of further improvements (Bigram: remove multi-token decode entirely; Unigram: index-first caching and batching; DRY: incremental algorithm and decimation; Orchestrator: centralize start-of-sentence; Tokenizer caches; micro-opts; config & observability).

Role: user
Content:
Please apply the modifications listed for specifically bigram and DRY.

Role: assistant
Content:
Implemented:
- Bigram: Added `prev_pos_is_start`/`next_pos_is_start` (CPU), updated via single-token decode in _cumulate_output_tokens; switched _apply and get_computed_hard_block_ids to use these flags (removed per-step multi-token decodes); kept race-safe clamping; filter/merge updated.
- DRY: Added `dry_stride` and per-request `_gen_counts` with decimation (run every N tokens), configurable via custom_params; kept batched per-row updates and `dry_max_search` default 32.
